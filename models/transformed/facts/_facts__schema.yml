  - name: fact__patient_access
    description: The 'fact__patient_access' model provides a comprehensive view of
      patient access data. It includes details about the user, medical group,
      and patient, along with the date of access. The model also provides
      various counts and sums related to access, such as the total number of
      accesses by a user or medical group, the number of accesses by a user or
      medical group on a specific date, and the cumulative number of accesses by
      a user or medical group up to a certain date. Additionally, the model
      provides similar counts and sums for patient-specific accesses. It also
      includes the total number of unique users and medical groups that have
      accessed a specific patient's data, as well as the cumulative number of
      unique users and medical groups that have accessed a patient's data up to
      a certain date. The data in this model is derived from the
      'raw_stellar_health_application__patient_access_log' and 'dim__user'
      tables.
