models:
- name: scenario_1_medical_group_retired_patients
  description: The 'scenario_1_medical_group_retired_patients' model is designed to
    provide a detailed analysis of the patient demographics within different medical
    groups. It specifically focuses on the age-based categorization of patients into
    'retired' (age 65 and above) and 'working' (below age 65). The model calculates
    the total number of retired and working patients for each medical group and computes
    the percentage of retired patients. The output is sorted in descending order of
    the percentage of retired patients, and limited to the top 25 groups. The model
    uses data from the 'fact__patient_access', 'dim__patient', and 'dim__group' tables
    in the 'stellar_health' database.
  columns:
  - name: group_id
    data_type: varchar
    description: The unique identifier for each medical group. This is a foreign key
      that links to the 'group_id' field in the 'dim__user' table.
  - name: group_name
    data_type: varchar
  - name: total_patients
    data_type: bigint

    data_type: double

    data_type: bigint
- name: scenario_1_patient_records
  description: The 'scenario_1_patient_records' model is a count of unique patient
    IDs from the 'fact__patient_access' table in the 'stellar_health' database. The
    model only includes records where the 'accessed_date' is within the last 14 months
    and the 'users_accessed_patient_to_date' is 5 or more. The output is a single
    bigint value representing the count of distinct patient IDs that meet these criteria.
